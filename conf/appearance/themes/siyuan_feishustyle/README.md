This is a dark theme manually imitated in the style of Feishu documents.

The Feishu style is a style with a strong office flavor. Compared with the original 'midnight', it is not as lively. It pays more attention to being steady and clear. Of course, compared with 'Notion' and 'VS Code', our Feishu style is still quite youthful.

Here are some praises for the document style collected from the Internet:

* Feishu brings visual enjoyment with its simple and elegant design style, fresh color combinations and smooth interface layout. From icons to the overall framework, every detail demonstrates refinement and meticulousness.

* When enterprises choose Feishu, they often "start with its appearance and finally fall for its capabilities". Feng Bin, the CEO of Wenheyou, said very frankly that the first reason why they chose Feishu was very simple: it looks good, and appearance is the primary productivity.

Attentive friends should have noticed that I manually imitated the LOGO.
